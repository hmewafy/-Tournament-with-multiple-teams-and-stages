# Tournament-with-multiple-teams-and-stages
This project simulates a sports tournament with multiple teams and stages. The project involves features for to calculate and provide a minimal-cost road network connecting all stadiums to optimize logistics and transit during the tournament, creating teams, dividing them into groups, simulating matches, scheduling group stage matches over a given number of stadiums, determining the winner, and advancing top-performing teams to the knockout stages. The tournament consists of a group stage followed by knockout stages. The knockout stages use single elimination matches to determine the champion. Along the way, the system tracks match results, schedules matches, and updates teams' standings, distributes the given budget between the teams in the group stage, and provides clear output on each stage outcomes . The program can also incorporate further advancements and features if needed in the future. This ensures a clear, structured path from the early group phase through to the last round, giving users a dynamic experience and a clear flow of steps.
